# PongProject
This is a project that i create as a completion of day 22 of 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu.
it's maybe a little different from what Angela Yu code, because i tried to do it myself and im proud of it.

it still have a bug, when i hold arrow key or wasd to move the paddle, it cannot keep moving. so you have to mash the button to move it :).
Anyway, had a lot of fun making it and can't wait to do next project.
